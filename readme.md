## Public-Private networks ##

### Introduction ###

We investigate the relationships of the authors and the research interests of the authors. In this repository, we offer all the links of the datasets and report some basic statistics. 

### Datasets ###

We investigate our research based on the dblp[1]. We divide the datasets into two parts based on the first publication of the papers. 

Datasets| n | m | n' | m'| ∂ 
----|----|----|----|----|---
[y-2013]() | 1,882,970 | 5,234,008 | 927,516 | 3,197,915 | 0.8654
[y-2015]() | 1,882,970 | 6,689,827 | 636,675 | 1,742,096 | 0.8977

	1. n is the number of the authors in the public networks.
	2. m is the number of the co-authors relationships in the public networks.
	3. n' is the number of the authors in the private networks.
	4. m' is the number of the co-authors relationships in the private networks.
	5. ∂ is the arevage common arevage research interests.
